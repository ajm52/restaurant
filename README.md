# restaurant

A Restaurant Simulation program. C++ backend, Javascript frontend. Using this to get practice with multithreaded socket programming.

This project was initially started back in November 2019; further development was curbed when I realized how much C++ knowledge I lacked and the amount of development idioms I was not considering.

After reading a few books (The Pragmatic Programmer, Effective C++), I began project development again from scratch. It would have probably been wise to keep old code, but I wanted a clean slate. Much of the prior code was poorly designed and heavily coupled.

This time around, development has intentionally been much slower with a heavy emphasis on intuitive class design/implementation, vigorous testing, and clean code. I am making a point to ensure that every committed class is paired with a unit test.
