This project is taking far longer than I initially expected for several reasons, and I'm okay with that.

I) In the first month of development, I spent next to zero time planning/designing and dove straight into coding. Taking the complexity of C++ for granted, I became quickly overwhelmed with what I was doing, and hit several circular dependencies, not knowing what to do with myself. Realizing how convoluted my code base was, I trashed the entire thing and started from scratch.

IIA) In the following 2-3 months, I spent an unwarranted amount of time trying to design my project to perfection, using polymorphic abstractions wherever I could, even if it meant reinventing the wheel. Here's an example: I knew I wanted to have a C++ codebase with a Javascript front-end, so I knew I would have to have some kind of networked message passing interface. I thought it would be intelligent to compose an abstract UpdateMessage class consisting of abstract Subjects and Predicates, as if I was reinventing the English language. Mind you, I hadn't even come close to getting the program to work in a terminal-based setting.

Insane, right?

IIB) During that time (Nov-Jan/Feb) I was also juggling GRE preparation and grad school applications on the side.

III) Given that I had been out of school for nearly a year with no source of income and no job offer from an unspeakable number of applications, I worked night shifts at a warehouse for a couple of months, at which point I was laid off due to COVID-19. While I was working, I hardly had the motivation to eat properly, let alone continue to code. I definitely let the circumstances get the better of me and am somewhat ashamed as a result, but I also recognize that everyone has their ups and downs. Sure, we see people like Musk and Zuckerberg and imagine them as infants, spitting out the cure for cancer before the age of 5. In reality, everyone has moments where they feel demotivated and are unproductive; what separates people is how they bounce back.

IV) After being laid off from work, I slowly revved my a\*\* back into gear, steadily ramping the amount of work I was doing on a daily basis. At this point, I am glad to say that I feel like I am back on track. Things are moving along, threads are being spun, progress is being made, and we are making our way toward the endgame.
